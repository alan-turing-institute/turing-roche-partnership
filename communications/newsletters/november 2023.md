**Tell us a little bit about yourself and your current research:**

I'm from Australia originally but moved to the UK for my PhD. My current research concerns the concept of rarity. Often, different biological modalities drive disease pathology, and the identification of these can lead to improved disease understanding and more targeted therapies. However, the most interesting modalities are usually those with few observations (rare groups)- if they had more, they would be easy to identify. Algorithms often fail to identify rare groups or when they do, there are many of them (false positives), and it is unclear why they have been identified. Having interpretable results is important to understanding possible causal factors of disease. Hence, we're aiming to develop methods that are better at detecting rarity and have been specifically formulated with interpretability in mind.  

**What is your planned community scholar project? Why is this of interest to you?**

Many researchers use similar tools to perform research- that is coding, debugging, version control, using high performance computers (HPCs), producing figures and graphics. Upskilling in these areas can be difficult, with documentation and coding workshops often targeted at a beginner level or quite application/field specific. 

My community scholar project is a sub community for technical knowledge sharing. There is a live slack channel in the [Turing-Roche Slack Workspace](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.gle%2FiEuDrC9Nb4w63YtWA&data=05%7C01%7Cvhellon%40turing.ac.uk%7C6a4e73d47593465e1f8f08dbe1179612%7C4395f4a7e4554f958a9f1fbaef6384f9%7C0%7C0%7C638351263684269264%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=p%2ButwxMwHcxTJIzTHImRGhovNd8K5DFruvOhKnCKuyo%3D&reserved=0) for people to engage, ask questions or share around specific tools they have found to be of use. Please join the "#technical-knowledge-share" channel if you're interested! In the new year, we will be circulating several "Techercise" seminars targeted at a more intermediate level, led by researchers and software developers in academia and industry to share some tips/tricks/coding ethos to help improve the way we do research, both in terms of reproducibility and efficiency. 

**What was your last impulse buy?**

A green scarf as a self birthday present. I'm obsessed with all things green. If you've been eyeing up something green, treat yourself. 

## Publication of the Month

**A Unifying Review of Deep and Shallow Anomaly Detection**

Our featured Community Scholar Ellen has chosen [this paper](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fstamp%2Fstamp.jsp%3Ftp%3D%26arnumber%3D9347460&data=05%7C01%7Cvhellon%40turing.ac.uk%7C6a4e73d47593465e1f8f08dbe1179612%7C4395f4a7e4554f958a9f1fbaef6384f9%7C0%7C0%7C638351263684269264%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=awgVOSD7m0MnnpPm2n2Q2ngj2SyTOECBrOytu7Wqr8A%3D&reserved=0) for our November publication of the month, which was published in the Proceedings of IEEE. 'This is a review paper on anomaly detection, which is quite closely linked to the concept of rarity. However, it's more a review on machine learning in general, with a flavour of anomaly detection. I found this paper super useful when first starting my PhD because it demonstrates how to evaluate and interpret different ML approaches with a core framework. This makes it easier to compare and understand differences between methods, and how method choice might impact our results and their interpretation.'
