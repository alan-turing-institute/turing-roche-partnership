# Community Scholar Project: Collaborators and researchers rapid answer interview
## Kuniko Paxton

### Overview of planned project
- Purpose
The aim is to ensure that the concept and goals of the Alan Turing Institute and Roche partnership project are widely understood and of interest not only to experts but also to general stakeholders.

- Contents
Divide collaborators and researchers into 2 teams and compete their scores by answering questions. The answers are judged by three primary school children. Each judge has 1 point and can award 1 point to the respondent when the answer is understandable or interesting. Thus, up to three points can be awarded for each question. The minimum score for a response could be zero.
