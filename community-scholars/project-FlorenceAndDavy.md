# Community Scholar Project: Data in Healthcare podcast (name TBC)
## Florence Townend and Davy Tennison

### Overview of planned project

one working in AI-enabled healthcare and the other in the philosophy of science.

Episode topics (subject to change):
1. Wearable tech
2. Hospitals and AI: how can they be combined
3. Open access healthcare data: uses and pitfalls
4. Health-tech Apps
