# Community Scholar Project:
Thomas Butters

### Overview of planned project
My proposed Community Scholar project is to run a short series of workshops in conjunction with the Turing-Roche team which would bring together clinicians and computer scientists in order to:

    - Consider the challenges of AI in healthcare, and share knowledge on creative methods to overcome them. 

    - Dispel myths surrounding the use of AI in healthcare.

    - Consider how AI might be applied to serve unmet needs in the medical community.
